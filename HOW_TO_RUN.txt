HO TO RUN THE SCHEDULER MANUALLY
===================================

Option 1: Background Loop (Recommended)
---------------------------------------
Double-click the "run_scheduler.bat" file in this folder.
- It opens a black window.
- It checks for messages every 60 seconds.
- Keep the window open to keep the scheduler running.

Option 2: Run Once (Manual Check)
---------------------------------
Open a terminal/command prompt in this folder and type:

    c:\xampp-new\php\php.exe cron_runner.php

This will check for messages *one time* and then exit.
